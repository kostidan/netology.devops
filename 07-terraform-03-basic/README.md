# Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

## Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

Создаем файл s3.tf со следующим содержанием:
```buildoutcfg
provider "aws" {
    region = "eu-central-1"
}


resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
    bucket = "netology-terraform-state"
    acl    = "private"

    versioning {
        enabled = true
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
    name = "netology-terraform-state-locks"
    billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
    hash_key = "LockID"

    attribute {
        name = "LockID"
        type = "S"
    }
}
```
После деплоя на сервере создается S3 хранилище. Добавим в s3.tf следующий блок:
```
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket = "netology-terraform-state"
        region = "eu-central-1"
        dynamodb_table = "netology-terraform-state-locks"
        encrypt = true
        key = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    }
}

```
После terraform init  стейты создадутся в S3

## Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы. 

Создаем файл main.tf:
```buildoutcfg
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
    }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
    }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

locals {
  web_instance_type_map = {
    default = "t3.micro"
    stage = "t3.micro"
    prod = "t3.large"
  }
  web_instance_count_map = {
    default = 0
    stage = 1
    prod = 2
  }
  instances = {
    ins1 = 0
    ins2 = 1
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = local.web_instance_type_map[terraform.workspace]
  count = local.web_instance_count_map[terraform.workspace]

  tags = {
    Name = "Netology-${terraform.workspace}-${count.index}"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_1" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = local.web_instance_type_map[terraform.workspace]
  for_each = local.instances
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "Netology-${terraform.workspace}-${each.value}-foreach"
  }
}

```
В блоке **data** описываем образ для инстанса. В блоке **locals** - значения для типов инстансов, количество инстансов 
для 
каждого воркспейса и инстансы для цикла **for_each**. Ресурс **web** создает инстансы для каждого воркспейса в нужном 
количестве через **count**, **web_1** - создает инстансы в количестве, определяемом **for_each**. Также в этом блоке 
указан 
параметр жизненного цикла **create_before_destroy**.

Новые воркспейсы создаются командой: 

`terraform workspace new prod`

`terraform workspace new stage`

Вывод списка воркспейсов:
```buildoutcfg
vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform-aws$ terraform workspace list
* default
  prod
  stage

vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform-aws$
```

Переключение на воркспейс prod:
```buildoutcfg
vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform-aws$ terraform workspace select prod
Switched to workspace "prod".
vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform-aws$ terraform workspace list
  default
* prod
  stage

vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform-aws$
```

Terraform plan для prod:
```buildoutcfg
vagrant@vagrant:~/terraform-aws$ terraform plan
aws_instance.web[1]: Refreshing state... [id=i-0c382bdde14512b57]
aws_instance.web[0]: Refreshing state... [id=i-00d5271726cc891a3]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
